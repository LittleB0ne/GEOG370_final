    <h2>Hawaii Choropleth Map</h2>

    <h3>This map shows the different numbers of residents ages 18-24 that have not obtained a high school diploma or educational 
        equivalent in each of Hawaii's five counties. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii's most populous county, Honolulu County, which spans the 
        island of Honolulu and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, has the largest number of youth without a high school diploma or 
        equivalent. But when it comes to a per capita basis, Kauai County has the most. Census data is unavailable for the smallest 
        county in the state both in terms of area and population, Kalawao County. </h3>
