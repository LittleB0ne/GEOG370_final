    <h2>Urban Heat Island Intensity by Zip Code in Wake County</h2>
    <img width="600" src="./WakeUHIIMap.png" alt="">
    <h3>This map visualizes the urban heat island intensity of each zip 
        code in Wake County. In an increasingly warm and increasingly 
        urban world, the urban heat island phenomenon is becoming a larger 
        issue to our collective health and well-being every year. So, 
        quantifying and visualizing just how intense that phenomenon can be 
        across different parts of our urban areas (in this case, Wake County, 
        NC) can help us better understand it. With an improved understanding, 
        we'll better be able to mitigate the negative effects of the urban 
        heat island phenomenon and reduce its intensity through our urban 
        form. </h3>
