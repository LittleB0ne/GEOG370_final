    <h1>Homework 6 Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Map Description</h2>
    <h3>This map shows the number of young adults with less than a high school 
        diploma or equivalent per thousand young adults in each of Hawaii's 
        five counties.</h3>
    <h2>Reason for Ratio</h2>
    <h3>The ratio set was residents aged 18-24 with less than a high school 
        diploma or equivalent divided by the total number of residents aged 
        18-24 multiplied by 1000. This was chosen as the ratio to help 
        visualize the percent of each county's youth population that lacked a 
        complete high school education in comparison to its total youth 
        population. Total youth population was used to normalize the data as 
        utilizing another category could have resulted in a map that was more 
        unhelpful. And the 1000 multiplier was used to help ground the data 
        in a commonly used, specific number of people.</h3>
    <h2>Equal Count Map</h2>

    <h3>This mode helps to clearly show the order in which the counties 
        rank in terms of their concentration of youth residents without 
        a high school diploma or equivalent. However, it isn't quite as 
        clear about the extent in which these counties range.</h3>
    <h2>Equal Interval Map</h2>
    <img width="600" src="./HawaiiYouthMap_EqualInterval.png" alt="">
    <h3>This mode gives a good idea of both how the counties rank amongst 
        themselves and how the concentration ranges, with Kauai County 
        having the largest concentration. The flaws aren't quite as easy 
        to see with the small sample size of counties, but it can 
        sometimes result in misleading visualizations when the data is 
        uneven.</h3>
    <h2>Pretty Breaks Map</h2>
    <img width="600" src="./HawaiiYouthMap_PrettyBreaks.png" alt="">
    <h3>This mode helps to show the vast difference between the county 
        with a higher concentration and all of the others. However, it 
        also is a little difficult to see the differences between all of 
        the other counties' concentrations.</h3>
