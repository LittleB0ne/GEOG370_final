    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <h3>This map answers the question, “what portions of North Carolina 
        do and do not have relative access to a degree-granting college 
        or university in their geographic proximity?” To answer this 
        question, I utilized a dataset of all universities and colleges 
        in North Carolina overlayed on polygons containing North Carolina 
        and all her counties. I first created a 15-mile buffer around 
        the points of all universities and colleges. I then took the 
        difference of the North Carolina county polygon and the buffers 
        to see the areas lying outside of the buffer. These areas in the 
        difference polygon are the ones without relative proximity to a 
        college or university, and the other areas in the other polygon 
        do.</h3>
